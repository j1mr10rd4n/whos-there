#WHO'S THERE?

A solution for a technical assessment test set by ~~company name redacted~~.

## About

The assessment involves implementing 3 API endpoints to imitate a reference version
given only as a swagger specification. 

Each endpoint was analysed with a set of exploratory functional tests and a matching
implementation was created as a standalone lib class with its own unit tests.
